# tinyframe
API for building statistical analysis and machine learning pipelines (written from scratch with example from other frameworks).

# Modules description

data_structures - data structures to work with different type of data. BaseFrame is a base class for tabular type of data.

dataloader - special class for loading data for further preprocessing.

eda - Automated Exploratory Data Analysis.

model - basic statistical models like linear regression or logistic regression.

deep_model - special module to build deep learning models.

# TODO:
1. Complete and improve the framework's structure.
2. Rewrite tabular loader to be implemented standard python library.
3. Finish developing the model module and test it in test.py on some publicly available datasets.
